// Given an array of integers and a target sum,
// determine the sum nearest to but not
// exceeding the target that can be created. To create the sum, 
// use any element of your array zero or more times.
// For example, if  and your target sum is , 
// you might select  or . In this case, you can arrive at exactly the target.

// Function Description

// unboundedKnapsack has the following parameter(s):

// k: an integer
// arr: an array of integers
// Input Format

// The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

// Each of the next  pairs of lines are as follows:
// - The first line contains two integers  and , the length of  and the target sum.
// - The second line contains  space separated integers .

// Output Format
// Print the maximum sum for each test case which is as 
// near as possible, but not exceeding, to the target sum on a separate line.
